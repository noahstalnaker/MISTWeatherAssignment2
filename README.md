# Weather and Wellness

This repository is for a Weather Health website for MIST 353 at WVU. The purpose of the website is to utilize real time and future weather data to inform users what health conditions may be at risk due to the weather based on a chosen location, and the things they can do to safely prepare themselves for it, as told by health professionals.
<br/>
<br/>
# Status and Page Overview

As of February 6th 2024, the websites current functionality includes a protoype for the Main, Today Report, Future Report, and About Me pages.
<br/>
<br/>

# Current functionality and future enhancements
Information about the current functionality of each page and the plan for it moving forward

## Main Page

The main page is the first page that is opened. This page includes a title, a search bar (not yet in use) for your desired location, and a directory to other pages.

- The main will utilize the search bar to store geolocation data in order to use the weather data for that location in the Today/Future Pages.
<br/>

## Today / Future pages

These pages are currently identical and are comprised of the layout of the page using cards. They have return buttons to the main pages. The today page will return information about today, and the future will return information based on the dates selected for those dates.

- These pages will utilize the results of the search bar on the main page to return the weather for those location(s), and inform you what health conditions will be at risk, and what you can do to prepare yourself.
<br/>

## About Me page

- This page will contain information about how the website works and include a FAQ.
